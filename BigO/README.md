# Big O

Big O is the way we analyze how efficient algorithm is. It's about the big picture, don't really care about the details. 

> Example: I don't particularly care if a function takes 300 milliseconds versus 330 milliseconds given 1,000 inputs, but I do care if it takes 300 milliseconds versus 30 seconds. This would be a difference in an order of magnitude, or basically we're saying we only care if the difference is pretty large.
